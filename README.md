Crystal is a general purpose object orriented compiled and statically typed programming language. Speaking from personal experience this language is one of my favorites due to its similar style to the ruby programming language. This language deals really well with data types and has a strong sense on servers. This repository will be used to show certian programs i made that i could not find online or were outdated. In a sense this repo will also be showing the basics to advanced of the crystal programming language.
